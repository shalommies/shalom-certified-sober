        <p>
            We're testing Sober, a brand new way to get Roblox on your Linux desktop.
            It's a novel approach, separate to other compatibility software like Wine, Android emulators, or virtual machines.
            Sober works by creating a specialized runtime just for Roblox's code, ensuring compatibility.
        </p>
        <p>
            We'd like to stress that Sober is an experimental project. It's a passion project rather than production-grade code.
            Sober's runtime incurs a performance penalty compared to Windows. While the results vary for everyone, generally Sober offers 1/3rd the performance of Windows.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sober is unfortunately closed-source. This could change in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
            We distribute Sober as a Flatpak package. To use it, just <a href="https://flathub.org/setup">make sure Flatpak is installed</a> and install the package. Then, open your favorite game. You'll be prompted to install Roblox. After that, you may visit any experiences on the platform, interact with other users, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sober is a labor of love, and we'd love for you to try it out! We hope you enjoy your time.
        </p>
